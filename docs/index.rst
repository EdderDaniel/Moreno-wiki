Welcome to the Moreno lab Wiki v0.0.1!
=====================================

Welcome to the Moreno Lab!

Much of your work here will involve intensive computation. To support this, we have a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster named **Kexol**. Kexol means [do not know yet].

This guide will walk you through the main steps to get up to speed, including:

#. Getting familiar with the resources available.

#. Creating an account to connect to the cluster.

#. Learning the SLURM job scheduler to run your analyses.

#. Running your fist job. 

#. Getting familiar with the backup policy of the lab.

Remember to always ask your co-workers if you get confused along the way and suggest changes to make the wiki better. 

Good luck!
